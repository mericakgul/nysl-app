// We could have exported some other named exported components here in the same module/file as shown below.
// However, we can only export one default per module/file as in App.js. We didn't use default export in this module

// export const Lala = () => {return ''}  --> We could have added these components as well in case of needed.
// export const Yaya = () => {return ''}
// export const Papa = () => {return ''}
